# Overview

In this assignment I explore and analyze a provided data set on used cars (pared down from a dataset found on Kaggle) following an uber-lite CRISP-DM process.

## Business Understanding

The client is a used-car lot. They need to know what factors drive price of a used car so they can set competitive prices and maximize profit.

The data task is to identify correlation between parameters and vehicle price, or parameter weights of one or more (more) regression models that will similarly inform which parameters contribute most positively and negatively to car price.

But first, the data must be cleaned; columns transformed and normalized as needed, and potentially combined (polynomial features, principal component analysis)

## Data Understanding

TODO: Wrangle some data.
